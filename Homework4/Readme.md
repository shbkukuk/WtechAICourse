**Build a neural network from scratch using Python!**

In this homework, you need to implement a neural network class in Python **without using** any framework library (i.e., tensorflow, keras, pytorch etc.). You can use numpy, pandas, math or any helper libraries.

Your neural network class should have following properties:

- Parametric input size
- Parametric output size
- Just implement fully connected layers; any number of such layers can be added (Letâ€™s keep it simple, no convolution, recurrent or other types of layers are needed!)
- At least 2 activation function alternatives for each layer (i.e., tanh, sigmoid)
- At least 2 loss function alternatives for output layer (i.e., mse, rmse)
- It should print training errors during training.

Your neural network should have any necessary methods/functions of your choice. But do not forget to include the following method/function names:

- fit/train: trains the neural network
- predict: makes prediction for the input data

Using your neural network class, train a neural network and make predictions on data to show the working and performance of your implementation. You should submit the data you used with a file name:nn\_data.csv

**Optionally,** you can implement a softmax function for the output layer that identifies which prediction class is the output. By using the softmax function, it will be easy to understand the output of the predictions.
